# Problem Statement

Managing books in small libraries or bookstores using handwritten registers or spreadsheets is slow, inefficient, and prone to mistakes. Staff struggle to quickly find books, check if they are available, and track which user has borrowed which book. Because of this, daily operations like searching, issuing, and returning books become time-consuming.

There is a need for a simple software system that can store book and user information, allow searching, and manage borrowing and returning in an automated way.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a basic **Online Bookstore / Library System** using Java that:

- Stores details of books (title, author, ISBN, availability)
- Stores details of registered users
- Allows searching for books by different criteria
- Supports issuing and returning of books
- Displays available and borrowed books

This project will also help understand core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** like classes, encapsulation, collections, and class relationships.

# Scope of the Project

- The system will be **console-based** (no GUI).
- All data will be stored **temporarily in memory** (no database).
- The system will support:
  - Adding books
  - Registering users
  - Searching books
  - Borrowing and returning books
  - Viewing available and borrowed books
- The system will be designed for a **single library**.

# Target Users

- Small library or bookstore staff
- Students learning Java and Object-Oriented Programming
- Beginners practicing Java programming and logical thinking
